## COLORS

I have tried several ways to add colors, and make them semantic, but create all the variants (correctly) is no reasonable manually. Until I found a way to assign semantic names (i.e. "primary", "primary-soft", "primary-softer") tailwind colors programatically, I suggest:

-   Use the shadcn colors as they are.
-   Then, after project is more advanced, fine tune the colors and create the variants you need.
    This is also good for not rely too much on colors to emphasize, but on other ways like shadows, borders, icons, width, etc.
